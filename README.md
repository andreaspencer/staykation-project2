# Project 2 - StayKation

## Description
This application is a social platform designed to accommodate the “new-normal” lifestyle in wake of Covid-19. It allows users to peruse suggestions posted by other users for local vacations, hence StayKations, that can be enjoyed in nearby cities, neighborhoods or even their own backyard. Users can create a personal profile that can be used to post suggestions, share ideas and photos of locations, venues and decorations to help make a StayKations adventure memorable. Users can also vote on posts to express their favorite idea or activity.
